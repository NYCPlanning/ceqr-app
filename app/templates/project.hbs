        <p><em>PUBLIC SCHOOLS.</em> CEQR analyzes potential impacts only on public schools operated and funded by the New York City
        Department of Education. This analysis generally relates only to public elementary and intermediate schools, which serve a
        local population, and rarely to high schools, which have a borough-wide or citywide population base. Schools are analyzed based
        on the potential for the project to cause overcrowding (i.e., a shortage of seats for an age group within the district).</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>If a project would physically alter a community facility, whether by displacement of the facility or other physical
        change, this "direct" effect triggers the need to assess the service delivery of the facility and the potential effect
        that the physical change may have on that service delivery. Temporary direct effects should also be considered
        (for example, the temporary closing of a facility during a phase of construction).</p>

      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Increased population in an area caused by a project would increase demand for existing services, which may result
        in potential "indirect" effects on service delivery. Depending on the size, income characteristics, and age distribution
        of the new population, there may be effects on public schools, libraries, or child care centers.
        In general, the following thresholds may be used to make an initial determination of whether detailed studies are
        necessary to determine potential indirect impacts.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="title">
        <h4><i class="dropdown icon"></i>221. Public Schools</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Potential impacts on schools may result if there would be insufficient seats available to serve the population.
        Because it is rare that a project physically displaces an operating school, impacts are more likely to occur
        when a project introduces school-age children to an area.</p>

        <p>The basic analysis begins with a calculation of the additional school-age population that would be introduced
        by a project. Table 6-1 above calculates by borough the minimum number of residential units that could yield
        at least 50 elementary/intermediate school children, based on Table 6-1a. To estimate the student age population
        of a project, first determine the number of residential units of the project. Projects that would add residential
        units designed exclusively for seniors or single adults (HPD supportive housing) need not assess public
        school impacts. If appropriate, Table 6-1a should be used to estimate the number of elementary, middle, and
        high school students likely to be generated by the proposed project.</p>

        <p>In general, if a project would introduce more than 50 school-age children (elementary and intermediate
        school students), significant impacts on public schools may occur and further analysis of schools may be appropriate.
        Since high school-level students can usually elect to attend high schools outside their neighborhood,
        an analysis of high school impacts is rarely necessary. However, if the project would generate 150 or
        more high school students, there may be an impact on borough high schools, and further analysis may be appropriate.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>If the preliminary analysis (Section 200) indicates that more detailed analyses are necessary for certain community
        facilities, the following approach may be used. This approach generally consists of delineating one or more study areas
        for the potentially affected community facilities, gathering information on current and future utilization levels and
        any plans for expansion, and, finally, assessing the potential impact of the project on community facilities.</p>

      <div class="title">
        <h4><i class="dropdown icon"></i>310. Study Areas</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The study areas for detailed analyses are different for each type of facility and are described below (Subsections 311-315).
        The community facilities examined in detailed analyses should be identified on maps that show the project site and area
        facilities, with the study area delineated (e.g., a line showing 0.5 mile radius from the project site). For a generic or
        programmatic project, a map for each neighborhood or district affected by the proposed project may need to be provided for
        those areas where the thresholds for preliminary analyses have been exceeded. In addition, if a community facility is to
        be directly affected by the proposed project, such as through the taking of land area or portion of a building used by the
        facility, it is sometimes helpful to provide a site plan or floor plan of the facility that shows the nature of the direct
        impact. Information for the initial identification of community facilities in the study area may be obtained from the Selected
        Facilities and Program Sites in New York City database and the Gazetteer of City Property (See Section 737). This information
        may be verified through field surveys and contact with relevant oversight agencies (see Section 730).</p>

      <p>The study area for the analysis of elementary and intermediate schools should be the school district’s “sub-district”
        in which the project is located. The GIS files for the sub-district boundaries (“regions” or “school planning zones”)
        are available, upon request, from the Department of City Planning. If the project or area rezoning straddles two or more 
        school districts or sub‐districts, the SCA’s Capital Planning Division should be consulted to determine the appropriate
        study areas for analysis. The locations of the elementary and intermediate schools should be shown on a map of the school
        district, with the sub-district study area delineated on the map. A scale bar should be provided on the map. If necessary,
        a separate map for elementary schools should be provided. If the threshold for examination of potential impacts on high
        schools has been exceeded, the study area for the high school analysis should be the borough in which the project is located.
        In addition, the location of the high school(s) near the area in which the project is located (within approximately a mile)
        should also be shown.</p>
