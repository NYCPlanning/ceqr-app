           <h4>210. Direct Effects</h4>
            <p>If a project would physically alter a community facility, whether by displacement of the facility or other physical
            change, this "direct" effect triggers the need to assess the service delivery of the facility and the potential effect
            that the physical change may have on that service delivery. Temporary direct effects should also be considered
            (for example, the temporary closing of a facility during a phase of construction). See Section 300, “Assessment
            Methods and Detailed Analysis Techniques”.</p>

          <h4>220. Indirect Effects</h4>
          <p>Increased population in an area caused by a project would increase demand for existing services, which may result
          in potential "indirect" effects on service delivery. Depending on the size, income characteristics, and age distribution
          of the new population, there may be effects on public schools, libraries, or child care centers.
          In general, the following thresholds may be used to make an initial determination of whether detailed studies are
          necessary to determine potential indirect impacts. </p>

    <h4>221. Public Schools</h4>
    <p>Potential impacts on schools may result if there would be insufficient seats available to serve the population.
    Because it is rare that a project physically displaces an operating school, impacts are more likely to occur
    when a project introduces school-age children to an area.</p>

    <p>The basic analysis begins with a calculation of the additional school-age population that would be introduced
    by a project. Table 6-1 above calculates by borough the minimum number of residential units that could yield
    at least 50 elementary/intermediate school children, based on Table 6-1a. To estimate the student age population
    of a project, first determine the number of residential units of the project. Projects that would add residential
    units designed exclusively for seniors or single adults (HPD supportive housing) need not assess public
    school impacts. If appropriate, Table 6-1a should be used to estimate the number of elementary, middle, and
    high school students likely to be generated by the proposed project.</p>

    <p>In general, if a project would introduce more than 50 school-age children (elementary and intermediate
    school students), significant impacts on public schools may occur and further analysis of schools may be appropriate.
    Since high school-level students can usually elect to attend high schools outside their neighborhood,
    an analysis of high school impacts is rarely necessary. However, if the project would generate 150 or
    more high school students, there may be an impact on borough high schools, and further analysis may be appropriate.</p>

    Detailed Analysis

    <h4>300. Assessment Methods</h4>
    <p>If the preliminary analysis (Section 200) indicates that more detailed analyses are necessary for certain community facilities,
    the following approach may be used. This approach generally consists of delineating one or more study areas
    for the potentially affected community facilities, gathering information on current and future utilization levels and any
    plans for expansion, and, finally, assessing the potential impact of the project on community facilities.</p>
