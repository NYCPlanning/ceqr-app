        <p><em>PUBLIC SCHOOLS.</em> CEQR analyzes potential impacts only on public schools operated and funded by the New York City
        Department of Education. This analysis generally relates only to public elementary and intermediate schools, which serve a
        local population, and rarely to high schools, which have a borough-wide or citywide population base. Schools are analyzed based
        on the potential for the project to cause overcrowding (i.e., a shortage of seats for an age group within the district).</p>

        <p>If a project would physically alter a community facility, whether by displacement of the facility or other physical
        change, this "direct" effect triggers the need to assess the service delivery of the facility and the potential effect
        that the physical change may have on that service delivery. Temporary direct effects should also be considered
        (for example, the temporary closing of a facility during a phase of construction).</p>
