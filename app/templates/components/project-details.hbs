        <p><em>PUBLIC SCHOOLS.</em> CEQR analyzes potential impacts only on public schools operated and funded by the New York City
        Department of Education. This analysis generally relates only to public elementary and intermediate schools, which serve a
        local population, and rarely to high schools, which have a borough-wide or citywide population base. Schools are analyzed based
        on the potential for the project to cause overcrowding (i.e., a shortage of seats for an age group within the district).</p>

        <p>If a project would physically alter a community facility, whether by displacement of the facility or other physical
        change, this "direct" effect triggers the need to assess the service delivery of the facility and the potential effect
        that the physical change may have on that service delivery. Temporary direct effects should also be considered
        (for example, the temporary closing of a facility during a phase of construction).</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Increased population in an area caused by a project would increase demand for existing services, which may result
        in potential "indirect" effects on service delivery. Depending on the size, income characteristics, and age distribution
        of the new population, there may be effects on public schools, libraries, or child care centers.
        In general, the following thresholds may be used to make an initial determination of whether detailed studies are
        necessary to determine potential indirect impacts.</p>

      <div class="title">
        <h4><i class="dropdown icon"></i>221. Public Schools</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Potential impacts on schools may result if there would be insufficient seats available to serve the population.
        Because it is rare that a project physically displaces an operating school, impacts are more likely to occur
        when a project introduces school-age children to an area.</p>

        <p>The basic analysis begins with a calculation of the additional school-age population that would be introduced
        by a project. Table 6-1 above calculates by borough the minimum number of residential units that could yield
        at least 50 elementary/intermediate school children, based on Table 6-1a. To estimate the student age population
        of a project, first determine the number of residential units of the project. Projects that would add residential
        units designed exclusively for seniors or single adults (HPD supportive housing) need not assess public
        school impacts. If appropriate, Table 6-1a should be used to estimate the number of elementary, middle, and
        high school students likely to be generated by the proposed project.</p>

        <p>In general, if a project would introduce more than 50 school-age children (elementary and intermediate
        school students), significant impacts on public schools may occur and further analysis of schools may be appropriate.
        Since high school-level students can usually elect to attend high schools outside their neighborhood,
        an analysis of high school impacts is rarely necessary. However, if the project would generate 150 or
        more high school students, there may be an impact on borough high schools, and further analysis may be appropriate.</p>
