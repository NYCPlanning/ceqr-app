          <p>Increased population in an area caused by a project would increase demand for existing services, which may result
          in potential "indirect" effects on service delivery. Depending on the size, income characteristics, and age distribution
          of the new population, there may be effects on public schools, libraries, or child care centers.
          In general, the following thresholds may be used to make an initial determination of whether detailed studies are
          necessary to determine potential indirect impacts.</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>Potential impacts on schools may result if there would be insufficient seats available to serve the population.
          Because it is rare that a project physically displaces an operating school, impacts are more likely to occur
          when a project introduces school-age children to an area.</p>

          <p>The basic analysis begins with a calculation of the additional school-age population that would be introduced
          by a project. Table 6-1 above calculates by borough the minimum number of residential units that could yield
          at least 50 elementary/intermediate school children, based on Table 6-1a. To estimate the student age population
          of a project, first determine the number of residential units of the project. Projects that would add residential
          units designed exclusively for seniors or single adults (HPD supportive housing) need not assess public
          school impacts. If appropriate, Table 6-1a should be used to estimate the number of elementary, middle, and
          high school students likely to be generated by the proposed project.</p>

          <p>In general, if a project would introduce more than 50 school-age children (elementary and intermediate
          school students), significant impacts on public schools may occur and further analysis of schools may be appropriate.
          Since high school-level students can usually elect to attend high schools outside their neighborhood,
          an analysis of high school impacts is rarely necessary. However, if the project would generate 150 or
          more high school students, there may be an impact on borough high schools, and further analysis may be appropriate.</p>
