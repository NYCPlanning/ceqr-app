NOTE ABOUT SCHOOLS DATA: Within frontend / app / fragments/public-schools, there are multiple fragment files that define computed properties for the schools-related CEQR data. These computed properties are often calculated using other computed properties and therefore can get confusing to keep track of. We have a specific Miro board that details the relationships between these different computed properties. Visit the CEQR section of the Data Update Playbook to access this Miro link.
