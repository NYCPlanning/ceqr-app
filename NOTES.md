# Existing Conditions

Caveat: Sometimes assume a percent of seats serve the students from that subdistrict


# No Action

- Enrollment changes
1. Demographic enrolment projections (school district level)
percent allocations from school districts to subdistricts (ceqr_sf_projection_2016_2025)

1a. enrollment by subdistrict percentages (ceqr_2019_enrollment_by_zone) 
1b. high school  (excel High School Statistical Forecasting Projections)


2. Students introduced by new housing (ceqr_housing_by_sd_2016)
est. at subdistric level
primary school vs middle school

Caveats: including additional developments – make adjustments to enrollment projections
(specifically to #2)

- Capacity changes (most annoying)
1. Is SCA adding a new school in this area? Construction status?
SCA Open Data -> 

Find planned capacity changes in school subdistrict
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/Capacity-Project-Site-Location/tesz-9suw
sca_project_sites_v03222018

If one is found, check construction start and projected completion
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Active-Projects-Under-Construction/8586-3zfm
sca_project_construction_v02222018

Confirm construction starts and projected completions using:
- Email SCA
- Potentially DOB Job Application Filings (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-Job-Application-Filings/ic3t-wcy2/data)


## DOE Sign. Utilization Change
1a. Mona gets an email DOE with list of proposed utilization changes
Look at All Proposals Database, flag schools that are encountering changes
- Match on the building id

2. Has DOE proposed a significant utilization change to a school in this area?
(If so, what? How does that impact capacity?)


# With Action
How many more students will we be adding?

- Capacity changes
1. Does the proposed action contain a school?

Calculations we have.

Utilization = Enrollment / Capacity (technically, Enrollment / Capacity)

## Outcome

"Significant adverse impact" if both are true 
- No-Action is greater than 100%
- No-Action to With-Action utilization increase 5% or greater
