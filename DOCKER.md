## Running with Docker and docker-compose

##### Requirements
- Docker & docker-compose installed and running on your machine
  - [macOs](https://runnable.com/docker/install-docker-on-macos), [windows 10](https://runnable.com/docker/install-docker-on-windows-10), [linux](https://runnable.com/docker/install-docker-on-linux)

### Getting Started
1. **Install frontend dependencies locally**
   ```sh
   # in your terminal:
   cd frontend  
   yarn
   ```
1. **Create a local .env file from [backend/.env-example](backend/.env-example)**.  In your `.env` copy that is `.gitignore`'d, update the variables as needed (see in-file comments for instructions)
   ```sh
   cd backend
   cp .env-example .env
   ```
1. _Optional_:  Instantiate the app with production or staging ceqr_rails data
   ```sh
   # creates a backup sql file in a git-ignored location that the postgis will recognize, bring into the container, and instantiate on container startup.  
   # When you log-in to ceqr-app, use your production ceqr-app user credentials (or staging, if you choose to dump and load the staging database)
   pg_dump --no-owner --no-privileges -f backend/db/backup/ceqr_rails_prod.sql $(CEQR_RAILS_PROD_DBCONN) # Get the db connection string from Heroku config vars ("DATABASE_URL")
   ```
1. **Start up the ceqr app**, with environment defined and all deps installed, and bring up the postgis with all dbs created and migrations applied:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up # append "-d" if you'd like it to run in background, as a daemon
    ```
1. **Confirm everything is OK** 
    ```sh
    docker-compose ps

    # should output =>

        Name                   Command              State            Ports
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ceqr-app_frontend_1   ./frontend-entrypoint.sh        Up(health: starting)  0.0.0.0:4200->4200/tcp, 7020/tcp, 7357/tcp
    ceqr-app_backend_1    ./service-entrypoint.sh         Up(healthy)       0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp
    ceqr-app_migrate_1   ./migrate.sh                    Exit 0
    ceqr-app_postgis_1   docker-entrypoint.sh postgres   Up       0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp
    ```
    _Note:_
     - `migrate` service is a short-lived container that sets up your backend for you. That's why it is State: Exit 0
     - `frontend` takes a _while_ to start up (ember builds are slow, this is a [known issue](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/troubleshoot/#/known-issues)), but the health check should give you signal on when things are good to go. Thankfully, after the initial super slow build, re-build for files changed during development are pretty seamless and speedy.

    To mess with env configuration like port mapping, etc check out `docker-compose.yml`.
     - Port mappings are defined in `ports` sections; to change the port a service is mapped to and exposed on on your machine, change the first port in the mapping, i.e. "3001:3000" if you want ceqr running on port 3001 on your machine

##### Docker Tips  
- When you `docker-compose up` for the first time (or if you cleanup the `postgis` volume that contains `ceqr_rails`), you'll have to Create an Account in CEQR App, then create a test project(s):  
  - Create Account

  - Check your terminal console for the email URL to validate.  Copy and paste the `http://localhost:4200...` url in your browser to validate.

  - Successful validation:

- If you want to stop the containers, click `CTRL + C`
  - Your `ceqr-rails` database (the user you created and projects) will be persisted in a docker volume connected to the `postgis` container.  
  - Restarting the containers with `docker-compose up` will return you to the state of the app you left it in.
- If you want to cleanup and start with a blank slate, run:  
  ```sh
  docker-compose down --volume
  ```

### Local Development
If you don't want to run the ember frontend inside the docker container, that's fine! It's slow! I feel ya! You can run the ember frontend on your local machine, hooked up to the docker backend like:
```sh
docker-compose stop frontend
cd frontend
HOST=http://localhost:3000 DISABLE_MIRAGE=true ember s
```

If you have updated backend packages, you can run the install/updates on your local machine or inside the docker containers (nice if you don't have bundler installed, for instance) like:
```sh
docker exec backend bundle install # to install new backend packages
```
Alternatively, if you delete `Gemfile.lock`, bringing up the containers will re-run the package installation (see `backend/entrypoint.sh`)


Ember server will live-reload changes to the frontend app for you, so there is no need to restart the docker services when making changes to files in `frontend/`


Rails reloads the entire server on every request by default in development more, so there is no need to restart the docker services when making changes to files in `backend/`, altho configuration changes require restart

### Running Migrations
Rails migrations are stored in /backend/app/db/migrate. 

In order to create a rails migration inside of a docker container follow these steps:

Run docker `docker-compose up`

Check which containers are running `docker-compose ps`

SSH into the backend docker container `docker exec -it ceqr-app_backend_1 /bin/bash`

Once inside the container, run the rails migration command `rails generate migration name_of_your_migration`

**For running the migrations in the Heroku UI:**

Navigate to the ceqr-app on the Labs Heroku account. Select the environment (e.g. staging) that you would like to run the migrations on. On the top right of the page, you will see a button that says "More". Click on this button and select "Run Console" from the dropdown menu. Type `bash` into the console and hit "Run". 

In order to run the migrations: `rails db:migrate`

If you created a new table and need to populate this table with data after running the migrations: 
`rails db:seed`

### Debugging
You can enter the running rails application by running:
```sh
docker exec -it ceqr-app_backend_1 bash
```
This is helpful if you want to run interactive rails commands, like `rails dbconsole` to get a psql session on your development `ceqr_rails` or `rails console` to inspect the state of the running application and troubleshoot.


You can debug client-side frontend javascript in the browser as usual
